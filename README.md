# code-store

This repository stores codes which are usefull when do experiments. These code can be regarded as demo code for some API or
some good coding experiences.

We always feel bad when we are writing codes which we have wirted before, even when we forget how to write them again. 
It's always the situation when we forget to use some API in some language. So this repository is targeted to solve this problem.
Just like a saying that the palest ink is better that the best memory.
