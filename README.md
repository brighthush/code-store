# code-store

This repository stores codes which are usefull for experiments. These code can be regarded as demo code for some API or
some good coding experiences.

We always feel bad when we are writing codes which we have wrote before, even when we forget how to rewrite them again. 
It's always the situation when we forget how to use some API in some language. So this repository is targeted to solve this problem.
Just like a saying goes that the palest ink is better than the best memory.
